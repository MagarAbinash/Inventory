the supplier column might not be needed because an item can be bought from different supplier
and in the item table a single supplier is only shown that is made with the first purchase so
this might not be needed got to search for it

we can show it differently by selecting supplier in order and show it to the manager what to do with the
purchase orders to select the supplier
